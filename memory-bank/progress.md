   - Create form functionality for the contact section
   - Integrate Calendly or similar tool for booking strategy sessions

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen components
   - Optimize images and assets for fast loading
   - Set up Next.js Image component for efficient image delivery

5. SEO and Accessibility:
   - Implement SEO best practices (meta tags, structured data, etc.)
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for accessibility

6. Testing:
   - Implement unit tests for components
   - Conduct cross-browser and device testing
   - Perform performance and accessibility audits

7. Deployment:
   - Set up deployment pipeline (likely with Vercel)
   - Configure custom domain and SSL

## Current Status

The project is in its initial development phase. The basic structure and core components have been set up, providing a foundation for further development. The focus is currently on building out the main sections of the home page and implementing the core functionality.

## Known Issues

1. Spline Integration:
   - The SplineSceneBasic component is a placeholder and needs to be properly integrated with an actual Spline scene.

2. Content:
   - Most sections contain placeholder content that needs to be replaced with final copy and assets.

3. Responsive Design:
   - The current layout may not be fully responsive and needs to be optimized for various screen sizes.

4. Performance:
   - Performance optimizations have not yet been implemented, which may affect load times and overall user experience.

5. Accessibility:
   - Accessibility features and ARIA attributes need to be added to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Develop the actual Spline 3D scene for the hero section
2. Implement full responsive styling for existing components
3. Create and integrate final content for the Services section
4. Set up basic navigation between sections
5. Begin implementation of the Portfolio section
