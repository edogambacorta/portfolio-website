# Progress: TheFactory AI Agency Portfolio Website

## What Works

1. Project Initialization:
   - Next.js project structure set up
   - Basic component structure created (HeroSection, ServicesSection, etc.)
   - Tailwind CSS integrated for styling

2. Core Components:
   - SplineSceneBasic component created for 3D graphics integration
   - CTAButton component implemented for calls-to-action
   - ServiceCard component created for displaying services
   - Tubelight navbar component integrated into the Header and refined
   - Focus cards component enhanced with circular arrow icon on hover

3. Main Page Layout:
   - Basic structure of the home page implemented in app/page.tsx
   - Sections defined: Hero, Services, Portfolio, Insights, About Us, Contact, Footer

4. Navigation:
   - Tubelight navbar implemented with improved styling and functionality
   - Smooth scrolling implemented with offset to account for header height
   - Navigation links set up for all main sections
   - Header hover effect implemented

5. User Interaction:
   - Focus cards now display a circular arrow icon on hover, indicating clickability
   - Subheader text in focus cards adjusted to prevent overlap with the new icon

5. Responsive Design:
   - Initial responsive design implemented for the header and navbar

## What's Left to Build

1. Content Implementation:
   - Populate all sections with final content
   - Create and integrate actual Spline 3D scene for the hero section
   - Develop content for Portfolio and Insights sections

2. Styling and Design:
   - Further refine responsive design using Tailwind CSS
   - Create and apply a cohesive color scheme across all components
   - Optimize typography and overall visual design

3. Functionality:
   - Create form functionality for the contact section
   - Integrate Calendly or similar tool for booking strategy sessions

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen components
   - Optimize images and assets for fast loading
   - Set up Next.js Image component for efficient image delivery

5. SEO and Accessibility:
   - Implement SEO best practices (meta tags, structured data, etc.)
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for accessibility

6. Testing:
   - Implement unit tests for components
   - Conduct cross-browser and device testing
   - Perform performance and accessibility audits

7. Deployment:
   - Set up deployment pipeline (likely with Vercel)
   - Configure custom domain and SSL

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress, with the header, navigation components, and focus cards refined and improved. The focus is now on building out the remaining sections of the home page and ensuring a consistent, responsive design across all components.

## Known Issues

1. Spline Integration:
   - The SplineSceneBasic component is a placeholder and needs to be properly integrated with an actual Spline scene.

2. Content:
   - Most sections contain placeholder content that needs to be replaced with final copy and assets.

3. Responsive Design:
   - While the header and navbar are now responsive, other components may need further optimization for various screen sizes.

4. Performance:
   - Performance optimizations have not yet been implemented, which may affect load times and overall user experience.

5. Accessibility:
   - Accessibility features and ARIA attributes need to be added to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Develop the actual Spline 3D scene for the hero section
2. Implement full responsive styling for existing components
3. Create and integrate final content for the Services section
4. Begin implementation of the Portfolio section
5. Conduct thorough testing of the updated header, navbar, and focus cards on various devices and browsers
6. Optimize the new circular arrow icon in focus cards for different screen sizes
