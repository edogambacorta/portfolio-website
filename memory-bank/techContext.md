4. Version Control:
   - Git for source code management

5. Command Line Interface:
   - Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows)

## Technical Constraints

1. Browser Compatibility:
   - Support latest two versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Graceful degradation for older browsers

2. Performance:

   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks

## Dependencies

Main dependencies (versions to be updated based on package.json):

1. Production Dependencies:
   - next
   - react
   - react-dom
   - @splinetool/react-spline (for Spline integration)

2. Development Dependencies:
   - typescript
   - @types/node
   - @types/react
   - @types/react-dom
   - autoprefixer
   - postcss

2. Deployment Target:
   - Vercel (recommended for Next.js applications)
   - Alternative: Any static file hosting service

3. CI/CD:
   - (To be implemented) GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. Performance Monitoring:
   - (To be implemented) Next.js Analytics or Google Analytics

2. Error Tracking:
