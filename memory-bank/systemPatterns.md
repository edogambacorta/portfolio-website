# System Patterns: TheFactory AI Agency Portfolio Website

## System Architecture
The website is built using a modern, component-based architecture leveraging Next.js and React. This approach allows for efficient development, easy maintenance, and optimal performance.

1. Frontend Framework: Next.js (React-based)
2. Styling: Tailwind CSS
3. 3D Graphics: Spline
4. Deployment: (To be determined, likely Vercel for seamless Next.js integration)

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Use of Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal SEO
2. Adoption of Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling
3. Integration of Spline for 3D graphics to showcase AI capabilities
4. Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability
5. Static site generation for performance optimization (to be implemented)

## Design Patterns in Use
1. Functional Components: React functional components are used throughout the application for a consistent and modern approach to component creation.
2. Props for Component Configuration: Components like ServiceCard use props for flexible configuration.
3. Composition: The main page is composed of smaller, focused components (e.g., HeroSection, ServicesSection).
4. Container/Presentational Pattern: (To be implemented) Separate data fetching and state management from presentation components.
5. Hooks: (To be implemented) Use React hooks for state management and side effects in functional components.

## Component Relationships
1. Page Structure:
   - Home component (page.tsx)
     ├── HeroSection
     ├── ServicesSection
     ├── PortfolioSection
     ├── InsightsSection
     ├── AboutUsSection
     ├── ContactSection
     └── Footer

2. Reusable Components:
   - SplineSceneBasic: Used in the HeroSection for 3D graphics
   - CTAButton: Reusable button component for calls-to-action
   - ServiceCard: Used to display individual services in the ServicesSection

3. UI Components:
   - (To be implemented) Card, Button, Input, and other basic UI components for consistent styling

## Data Flow
1. Static Content: Most content is currently hardcoded in components. Future implementations may involve:
   - CMS integration for dynamic content management
   - API calls for fetching dynamic data (e.g., blog posts, portfolio items)

2. User Interactions:
   - CTAButton handles user clicks for booking sessions or navigation
   - (To be implemented) Form submissions for contact and inquiries

## Styling Approach
1. Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
2. Global styles defined in app/globals.css
3. Component-specific styles using Tailwind classes

## Performance Considerations
1. Next.js automatic code splitting for faster page loads
2. (To be implemented) Image optimization using Next.js Image component
3. (To be implemented) Lazy loading of off-screen components
4. Efficient rendering through React's virtual DOM

## Scalability and Maintainability
1. Component-based architecture allows for easy addition of new features
2. Separation of concerns through focused components
3. (To be implemented) TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience
4. (To be implemented) ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency

This system patterns document outlines the current architecture and design decisions for TheFactory AI Agency portfolio website. It serves as a guide for maintaining consistency in development and making informed decisions as the project evolves.
